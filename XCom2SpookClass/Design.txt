-------------------------

WANT
Wired - Immune to irritating stuns, panics, disorients, unconsciousness and mind control. Can't be revealed by drones.
Phantom
Veil (Passive) - Rank-based detection range reduction. (No infiltration boost.)
Distract (Free) - Distract nearby enemies toward a targeted location. Long throw range. Medium sound radius. Causes yellow alert, stealth. Cooldown 3.
Meld (Passive) - Can't be revealed once in high cover.
Vanish (>|) - Smoke, grant concealment and a concealed bonus move. Charges = 2.
Exfil (>|) - Releases a smoke cloud and exit the AO. Charges = 1.
Exodus (>|) - Targeted AoE. Releases a smoke cloud. All allied units in the AoE exit the AO. Charges = 1.
Exeunt (Passive) - Evac times are reduced by 1 turn for each NRO Delta Agent on a mission, to a minimum of 1 turn. If only NRO Delta Agents are on a mission, evac is always 1 turn.
Operator (Passive) - Planting X4 (to destroy facilities), hacking a door, opening loot boxes, punching out VIPs, Eclipse, and picking up and putting down bodies do not consume an action or end your turn.
    NOTE: If we changed the spook's team briefly before hacking etc. resetting afterwards we can perhaps prevent reveals by Kismet on VIP and rescue missions. In theory we could prevent reveal by modifying visibility from spook to VIP but then the objective won't complete.
Eclipse (>|) - Render an adjacent ally (soldier or civilian) unconscious (and carryable) even if mind controlled. Does not break concealment. Clips, BA, gimme clips. (Uses the VIP "punch" icon.)

QUITE NICE
Eidolon (Free) - Self and all Phantom allies gain concealment. Charges = 1.
Surgeon - Your combat knife attacks do +3 damage and have +10 aim.

DIPLOMATIC
Rorschach (Passive) - When advisor, shows an icon in haven if there are faceless infiltrators on base.
Diplomatic Training (Passive) - Rebels gain Fortify.
Negotiator (Passive) - Rebels gain Combat Fitness (4 aim, 1 mobility, 2HP, 4 will and 4 dodge).
Embassy (Passive) - Rebels gain Formidable (two extra ablative HP and 50% less damage from explosives).
Asylum (1) - Target rebel in LOS exits the AO. Works during terror missions.
Ambassador (Passive) - Rebels gain Tactical Sense.
Diplomatic Bag (Passive) - Rebels gain Carapace Plating.

SPARE

Opportunist
Battle Hardened (Passive) - Immune to stun, unconscious, panic, disorient.

XP ("KILLS") PER MISSION
LW2

SoldierXP = Round(MissionStartingEnemies / Max(3, SquadSize) x (ClassMultiplier ?? 5.7)) + 1 x StartingEnemiesKilled

e.g. Solo an 8 enemy mission, 1 kill = Round(8 / 3 x 5.7) + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16
e.g. 6 man a 12 enemy mission, 1 kill each = Round(12/6 x 5.7) + 1 = 12
(e.g. Solo a 20 enemy mission, 0 kills = Round(20/3 x 5.7) = 38)
(e.g. Solo an 8 enemy mission, kill them all = Round(8 / 3 x 5.7) + 8 = 23
