Primary weapon: Needle Rifle (new): Ranged, 1-3 damage, crit +2 (laser 2-4 +2, mag 3-5 +2, gauss 4-6 +3, plasma 5-7 +4). Same build cost as LW2 Assault rifles same level; NeedleRifle_CV = free.
Secondary weapon: Baton (new): Melee, 1-3 damage, crit +1 (laser 2-4 +1, mag 3-5 +2, gauss 4-6 +2, plasma 5-7 +3). Same build cost as LW2 Pistols same level; Baton_CV = free.

Levelling grants: extra mobility every few ranks (for Sap and Cosh).

Prospective Abilities:

BASIC
* Phantom
* Covert
* Exeunt (Passive) - Evac times are reduced by 1 turn for each NRO Delta Agent on a mission, to a minimum of 1 turn. If only NRO Delta Agents are on a mission, evac is always 1 turn.

BATON GRANTS

Cosh (>|)- Fleche range, deals weapon damage, and disorients non-robotic targets for 1 turn. Grants a free move action (a la Hit & Run). Breaks concealment, induces alert, will activate, etc.
Sap (>|) - Fleche range, deals minroll damage and stuns enemy for 1 (enemy) turns; and on a crit, deals minroll+crit damage and renders an enemy unconscious (if not killed by the crit). Grants a free move action afterwards. Does not break concealment (even if moving through detection range, though ending your turn in detection and LOS will break concealment on their next turn.) Not usable on robots. Does not induce yellow alert nor activate. If unconscious enemy survives battle, does not grant corpse or loot.
Baton Round (Freee) - Fires a silent shot which generates a small noise some distance away. Does not break concealment. Does not cause yellow alert, but does cause pods in earshot to move/pause to investigate. 1 turn cooldown (so you can't spam it multiple times per turn). [Maybe it'll have to cause yellow alert for AI, but will wear off after n turns unlike usual yellow alert. Maybe just drop their move to zero, AoE touch units, entire pod stopped. We'll see.]

FOOTPAD

* LCPL Ghostwalker (Free) - Per LW2.
 CPL Eclipse (>|) - Render an adjacent ally (soldier or civilian) unconscious (and carryable). Does not break concealment. Clips, BA, gimme clips. (Uses the VIP "punch" icon.)
 SGT Farsight (Passive) - Dramatically increases vision range.
SSGT Blackjack (|>) - Like Sap but always crits, ergo always renders enemy unconscious. 2 turn cooldown (like Run & Gun). If unconscious enemy survives battle, you don't get the corpse or any loot.
TGST Operator (Passive) - Planting X4 (to destroy facilities), opening loot boxes, punching out VIPs, Eclipse, and picking up and putting down bodies do not consume an action, break concealment or end your turn.
GSGT Shroud (Passive) - Enemies have an additional 25% smaller detection radius against you. Stacks with Covert and Ghostwalker.
MSGT Eidolon (Free) - The soldier, and all allies with Phantom, gain concealment. Does not consume an action. 1 use per battle.

RESPONDER (EMERGENCY/COMBAT)

LPCL Puncture (1) - Fire a shot which always hits and deals 1-2 damage, not piercing armor (2 armor = no damage). Does not activate or break concealment. Does not end turn (so can do it twice). Does not gain bonuses from Pinpoint.
 CPL Takedown (1) - Fire a standard shot from concealment with +20% crit chance. Requires concealment. Does not activate, but will put the pod on yellow alert (investigating where they stand). If the target dies, retain concealment. Does not end turn (so can Cocoon if it goes south). Enemies killed with Takedown do not grant corpses or loot.
 SGT Cocoon (>|) - Casts Statis on self for 1 enemy turn. Hence you regain control next turn unharmed. 3 turn cooldown.
SSGT Pinpoint (>|) - Gain 10% aim, 8% crit and 5 damage vs the targetted enemy. Stacks until you use it on a different enemy, then resets. Does not activate or break concealment. Usable on all standard shots including Takedown. Does not affect corpses or loot (i.e. you can still get them, unless you Takedown).
TSGT Exfil (>|) - Releases a smoke cloud and exit the AO.
GSGT Thunderflash (Passive) - Your flashbangs now stun enemies (including robots) and reduce their vision and detection radii to 0, all for 2 (enemy) turns, does not activate or break concealment, but will put the pod on yellow alert (investigating where they stand) and nearby pods on yellow alert (due to the noise).
MSGT Vanish (>|) - Releases a smoke cloud, consume remaining actions, gain a free move action and then gain concealment if possible in new location. 3 turn cooldown. 2 uses per battle.

DEMOLITIONS

LCPL Sapper - Per LW2.
 CPL Satchel Charge (1) - Throw/place a satchel charge which when detonated does ludicrous damage to cover (and 20 damage to alien relays) in a 1 tile radius. Does not damage enemies. May be thrown, not just placed. Consumes 1 frag grenade. Grants Detonate. 2 turn cooldown. Does not break concealment.
* SGT Heavy Ordinance (Passive) - Per XCOM 2.
SSGT Mini4 (1) - Attach a miniature X4 charge to a target enemy. Consumes 1 frag grenade. Does the same damage as the consumed grenade. Grants Detonate. Cannot crit. Does not break concealment.
TSGT Shrapnel (Passive) - Mini4 deals +5 damage, has +3 radius, and can 50% crit for +2 more damage (more damage and radius than WOTC = LW2 higher health and more foes). Your grenades and standard rockets can 30% crit for +2 damage.
GSGT Pyrotechnics (Passive) - Utilise incendiary grenades for Mini4 and Satchel Charge, and gain the effect of Dragon Rounds while carrying an incendiary grenade. Grants additional Flaming Mini4 (1) and Flaming Satchel Charge (1) abilities (if you have the base ones), whose damage to enemies is replaced with 4-9 damage in a 3 tile radius, with a 60% chance for burning. Environmental damage is unchanged. Cooldown if any is the same. Lack of concealment break is the same. Requires and consumes an incendiary grenade instead. While carrying an incendiary grenade, primary weapon shots also deal the effect of Dragon Rounds (+1 damage, *may* set enemies on fire).
MSGT Mad Bomber (2) - Construct an additional frag grenade and an additional incendiary grenade. Requires both actions. 3 turn cooldown. 3 uses per battle. Does not break concealment.

(Detonate (>|) - Detonates all planted explosives. Does not break concealment.)

CONSIDER....

Swapping Phantom and Eclipse, and swapping Takedown and Cocoon.

And then *maybe* even Cocoon (new position) and Operator, or maybe not, indeed. I like the alternating Takedown, Cocoon (safety), Pinpoint,  Exfil (safety), Thunderflash, Vanish (safety).


CHANGES...

Add Needle Rifle.

Fix visualisation of concealment-breaking (red tiles) on Sap and Blackjack.

Drop Covert (Squaddie), Ghostwalker (LCPL) and Shroud (GSGT). Instead grant Squaddies Veil, giving them -25% detection radius with a further -10% per rank as they level up automatically.

Add a cooldown to Sap, and make it only usable from concealment. Same with Blackjack, also requiring concealment, and separate (or same, but separate = a bonus) cooldown.

Replace Ghostwalker with Spike, which KOs small robots (i.e. drones) into unconsciousness, with a cooldown like Sap, and only usable from concealment. No effect on mechs, even the small ones.

Move Operator to Squaddie rank, and add hacking to Operator's list of affected abilities.

Replace Operator with...?

Replace Operator with Silent Running, which replaces your remaining actions with move only actions that don't break concealment at all. Cooldown. Then with the below maybe reorder the LHS tree.

Change Puncture to do base damage but can't crit? Since Needle Rifle now is lower damage anyway. Maybe change it to do Bleed damage instead, so nothing initially then DoT for a few turns on enemy turn (so take damage almost immediately afterwards). Then if it activates due to not activating being hard, less of an issue?

Shroud is replaced with Surge, like Spike but works on any mech, but with a cooldown like Sap. (A little OP but by GSGT, troopers with plasma rifles can one shot a mech anyway?)

If Surge is OP, replace with a new Shroud, which grants a buff giving concealment and the soldier's Veil -percent detection radius to any civilian ally who moves within a 4 tile radius, but they lose this buff concealment at the end of the player turn if they're not within the radius. Ideal for late game extracts.

Or if Operator is gone, move Exfil and Vanish to Footpad tree, drop Eidolon, use Surge instead of Shroud, and create new TSGT and MSGT Demolitions abilities.

Or, you know, whatever.
