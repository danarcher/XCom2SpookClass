*"Spooks conduct black bag operations in enemy territory. Experts at stealth, they prefer not to engage enemies directly."*

Spooks are not a combat-oriented class. They are best deployed solo, where they can readily complete certain classes of mission alone or in small groups with other Spooks, especially once reaching a high rank.

Spooks require, and automatically undertake, special training between missions to maintain their abilities (see post-mission training, below). This encourages their occasional use on missions to which they are particularly suited.

This mod is not compatible with War of the Chosen, nor LWOTC. It is also incompatible with other mods which make equally substantial changes to concealment mechanics, such as Peek from Concealment.

All content is subject to future balance tweaks and other changes without notice.

## Weapons

Spooks are lightly armed, since they rely on stealth rather than martial force to complete objectives.

### Spook Pistol

![Spook Pistol](XCom2SpookClass/Media/Docs/SpookPistol.jpg)

*"A sidearm carried exclusively by Spooks, they favour this pistol over larger, more powerful but cumbersome weapons."*

The Spook Pistol is extremely accurate at close range. It is deeply inaccurate at longer ranges.

**Conventional** 3-4 damage, +2 on a crit, short sound range, unlimited ammo.

**Magnetic** 5-6 damage, +3 on a crit, short sound range, unlimited ammo.

**Plasma** 7-8 damage, +4 on a crit, short sound range, unlimited ammo. Plasma weapons also cause targets to take 1 additional damage on future hits. 

### Combat Knife

## Acquiring Spooks

Rookies do not automatically become Spooks after ranking up.

One Spook can be obtained from a new Point of Interest on the Geoscape, immediately upon starting  a new game.

Further Spooks can be trained in the GTS. It is recommended not to have more than three Spooks on your roster in a Long War 2 campaign; though this is not currently enforced as a mechanic, this retains some balance between stealth and combat missions, and ensures your A team will have gained sufficient experience for the endgame.

## Post-Mission Training

After each mission in which they participate and are not injured, Spooks are unavailable for several days as they undergo post-mission training to maintain their abilities. This does not grant them new abilities or rank, but limits their continuous field deployment, encouraging the commander to rotate through other troops. It befits their occasional use as situational specialists.

Spooks serving as Haven advisors forgo their post-mission training, since this requires their full attention and prevents their deployment on other missions in any case.

## New/Unusual Mechanics

* **Wired** effectively reduces Drone detection range to zero, for Spooks only. This is unlike all other classes, where detection range is fixed for the detector and apply to all victims, and detection modifiers are fixed for the victim and apply to all detectors. Some rather unusual ability triggers are employed to ensure that concealment-breaking tiles and "Gotcha Again" style pathing indicators are correctly updated. The Wired modifier is visible as a debuff applied to enemy drones... only during the player's turn.

* **Veil** grants a rank-dependent stat bonus, so higher ranked Spooks receive a greater detection modifier, further reducing enemies' detection range.

* **Meld** and **Vanish** grant an effect internally known as Shade, which has a custom visual effect (temporarily altering soldier pawn component materials, and later restoring them) and renders the soldier undetectable for its duration. In the case of Meld, Shade is only applied at the end of the player's turn and lasts until the start of the next turn, and requires the Spook to be in high cover or adjacent to certain kinds of objective. In the case of Vanish, it only lasts for the bonus move.

* **Distract** is capable of temporarily redirecting AI even at green alert and without affecting their alert status, and cannot use the base game's AI alert mechanic since those alerts are long lasting and hence somewhat hard to control. The mod achieves this by modifying enemy AI behaviour trees to prioritise potential distractions. Distract grants 2 uses of a temporary "distract grenade" to the Spook for each tactical battle. Since units entering red alert need to no longer be distracted, the base game effect which applies red alert to units is overridden, and its visualiser is modified to inform the player that the relevant enemies are no longer distracted.

* **Dart** will cause damaged enemies to reach yellow alert, but not red alert. This is the only damage type which does not cause enemies to immediately enter red alert, since that behavior is built-in to the base game. Members of the target's patrol group are informed of an unusual "sound" coming from the target in order to generate the yellow alert. In addition, enemies which die from the bleed effect caused by Dart do not cause the patrol AI to hang. The unfortunate enemy is removed from his patrol group upon death, and the patrol group elect a new leader. This is all transparent to the player.

* **Operator** grants Spooks unique variations of standard perks with reduced cost and which do not break concealment. The mod achieves this through pre-mission ability template substitutions for Spooks with the Operator perk, rather global modifications to the base game ability templates at startup. Further, Operator permits Spooks to carry more than one loot item during Long War 2 Smash'N'Grab missions, and to collect them all without breaking concealment. As well as overriding the standard quest item pickup rules for the mission, the mod has to employ custom evac handling to ensure that bonus loot is awarded for each extra quest item the Spook is carrying, since mssion Kismet only awards one loot item per soldier upon evac. Since the number of maps for Smash'N'Grab is quite limited, and resources are critical in Long War 2, this is intended as a rebalancing mechanic.

* **Eclipse** allows Spooks to knock out VIPs, including during VIP extraction missions. This does mean that high ranking Spooks can complete these missions trivially, on turn one, by punching out the VIP, picking them up, and immediately exitting the AO without evac. Mid-ranking Spooks with Phantom and Operator can also complete these missions with minimal risk, since with Operator, Eclipse does not break the concealment granted by Phantom. This allows the commander to focus their time on other missions in the mid-late game.

* **Exfil** and **Exodus** both permit units to exit the AO without evac, but with all the usual effects of evac intact.

* The mod's various concealment-retaining mechanics are achieved by completely supplanting the base game's handling of unit sight of other units and the breaking of concealment, in order to introduce exceptions.

* Post-mission training is implemented rather like Long War 2 officer training, though it is triggered automatically after each mission and does not occupy a staff slot in a facility.
